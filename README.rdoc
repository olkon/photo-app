== PhotoApp
Third Ruby on Rails learning project for a Udemy course. An image uploading service.

=== Features
* Upon registration, users can upload and browse all users' images in the service. There's a catch: you got to pay 10$ to get in!
* Payment for the service is handled by Stripe[https://stripe.com/]. Registration form does some AJAX magic to OK/not-OK the Stripe processing before the rest of it. (The app's test environment Stripe runs with Monopoly money only. You can use the payment info "4242 4242 4242 4242" + any 3 digit cvv + valid expiry date" for testing purposes!)
* Customized Devise[https://github.com/plataformatec/devise] for other registration & authentication stuff. Now with a confirmation mailer!
* Carrierwave[https://github.com/carrierwaveuploader/carrierwave] on top of Fog[https://github.com/fog/fog] for image uploading in different environments.
* Images are stored on Amazon S3[https://aws.amazon.com/s3/] in production, locally in development.
* Minimagick[https://github.com/minimagick/minimagick] for easy resizing of images.
* Twitter-Bootstrap[https://github.com/seyhunak/twitter-bootstrap-rails] to jumpstart styling.
